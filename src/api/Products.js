Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind has become an international phenomenon attracting a legion of fans from Bill Gates and Barack Obama to Chris Evans and Jarvis Cocker, and is published in over forty-five languages worldwide. It was a Sunday Times Number One bestseller and was in the Top Ten for over nine months in paperback. His follow-up to Sapiens, Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow was also a Top Ten Bestseller and was described by the Guardian as 'even more readable, even more important, than his excellent Sapiens'. His most recent book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, was a Number One Bestseller and was described by Bill Gates as 'fascinating' and 'crucial'.`

                Wilde’s first play, Vera: Or the Nihilists, did not meet much success. He refined his ideas about art, its purpose and supremacy and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity and beauty into his only novel, the Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). Continuing his interest in theatre he wrote Salome, a play in one act, in 1891.
                Wilde became one of the most successful playwrights of the late Victorian London after producing four comedies—Lady Windermere’s Fan, a Woman of No Importance, an Ideal Husband and the Importance of Being Earnest. First performed in 1895 in collaboration with George Alexander at St. James’s Theater, London, the Importance of Being Earnest was considered Wilde’s masterpiece and continues to remain his most popular play. the Ballad of Reading Gaol, published in 1898, was his last work.

            `Ok, the book is an undeniable classic - I don't believe I need to praise Charles Darwin on his knowledge or manner of communication (others have done that).
            The FINGERPRINT (FP) CLASSICS print that was available on Amazon.in is what my rating is for. It is a good print (readable font size, spacing) with decent paper and binding - especially for a 500 page book at the discounted price point. The one star that I have docked is for this rather irritating proof reading error throughout the text - where words like "indirect" and "inactive" have been written repeatedly as "in direct" and "in active" !!
            While the human brain quickly corrects interpretation with reference to context, there are times when the error - what is obviously an "AI based" autocorrect editor function at work - gets in the way. Hope the publishers get this message and correct this soon in the next reprint.
            Otherwise, in the battle for superiority between species, AI seems to have come up with an insidious strategy of sabotaging the best of homo sapien literature!! ;)`

                name: 'Stephen Hawking',
                about: `Stephen Hawking is Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and author of A Brief History of Time which was an international bestseller. His other books for the general reader include A Briefer History of Time, the essay collection Black Holes and Baby Universe and The Universe in a Nutshell. In 1963, Hawking contracted motor neurone disease and was given two years to live. Yet he went on to Cambridge to become a brilliant researcher and Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. Since 1979 he has held the post of Lucasian Professor at Cambridge, the chair held by Isaac Newton in 1663. Professor Hawking has over a dozen honorary degrees and was awarded the CBE in 1982. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and a Member of the US National Academy of Science. Stephen Hawking is regarded as one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists since Einstein.`

            review: [`This is a collection of seven related lectures by Hawking originally published in 1996 under the title, The Cambridge Lectures: Life Works. He does not cover as much ground here as in did in A Brief History of Time, but what he does cover he does so in a charming and engaging style. There are some few statements here that could be interpreted as less than modest--although not by me--and a mistaken prediction or two, which may be a reason that Hawking is not pleased with this book's publication. He might also object to the title, since neither a "Theory of Everything" nor a conclusive answer to the origin and fate of the universe are presented. However, Hawking does address these questions, and his expression is interesting to read and has the agreeable characteristic of being laconic. There are no equations in the book, no mathematics as such, and everything is explained in language that would be intelligible to a high school student. There are the usual droll Hawking jokes about God and His intentions, facetious, epigram-like understatements (I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. p. 66) and witty asides about the convergence of politics on physics, as when he mentions a particle accelerator the size of the Solar System that "would not be funded under current economic conditions." --By Dennis Littrell on March 23, 2003`, 
            `Stephen Hawking's The Theory of Everything is a short book that can act as an introduction to the subjects of cosmology raised by modern science, but the book is only that; I preferred his Brief History of Time to this work because it was longer, more detailed, and covered more ground. If you are looking for a very basic introduction to the current thinking of astrophysicists, this is a good book; if you really want to wrestle with the subject at length, you should buy a Brief History of Time, or one of Paul Davies works, such as About Time. If you are looking for a good lecture series on physics, Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces and its sequel, Six Not So Easy Pieces is really the finest of this genre. That being said, the book does a good job in outlining the basic subject matter, discussing the development of the Big Bang theory, and the implications of both the general theory of relativity and quantum physics on the formation of the universe. Hawking is at his best when discussing singularities -- the points of the universe, such as black holes, where the laws of physics break down. --By D. W. Casey on June 27, 2002`, `this is one of the most interesting book . hawking has explained the whole universe very briefly . the book explains following things deeply *ideas about universe *expanding universe *black holes *origin and fate of universe *the direction of time * the theory of everything the book explains everything from beginning to the end of universe. it shows the interaction between science and natural powers. science lovers it will lead ur knowledge to a next level --By Shiva Thakur on 30 Sep 2012`
